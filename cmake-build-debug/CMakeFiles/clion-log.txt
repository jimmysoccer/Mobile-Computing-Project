CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcpprestsdk.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "cpprestsdk", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "cpprestsdk" with
  any of the following names:

    cpprestsdkConfig.cmake
    cpprestsdk-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "cpprestsdk" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "cpprestsdk_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "cpprestsdk" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
